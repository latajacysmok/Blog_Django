# Blog_Django
This is my final version of the blog.
I have many functionalities here such as login, logout, user registration. 
A special view and possibilities for logged in and not logged in.
Possibility to add, edit and delete posts by the proprietor.
The post has basic information about when it was created, when it was eventually edited, who created it, what tags it has.
A logged in user has the option of commenting on posts, deleting and editing his posts, giving likes and posting a given post.
Each user has his own profile with some basic information such as: avatar, username, sex, city he comes from, birth year, etc.
You can also visit profiles of other users and even write messages to them.
It is possible to send information to the administrator.
The website administrator has the option of adding new tags.
An API is also added which displays the recently added posts.
